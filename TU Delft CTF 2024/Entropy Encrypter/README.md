# Entropy Encrypter
**Category:** Hardware
**Difficulty:** Medium

## Description
I'm using a hardware random number generator, there's no way you can guess the key I used to generate these passwords!

## Solution
Short pin 26 to the ground so that the generated OTP consists of only zeroes.
(note: the source code of the firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/TU-Delft-CTF-Team/badge-firmware-2024)).
