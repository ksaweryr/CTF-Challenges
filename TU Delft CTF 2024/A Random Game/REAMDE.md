# A Random Game
**Category:** Crypto
**Difficulty:** Hard

## Description
Can you beat me 10 times at my own game? I'll even allow the use of randcrack.

## Solution
With simple algebraic manipulation, it is possible to reduce the set of possible keys to 2 elements (see [solve.py](./src/solve.py)). Alternatively, a symbolic Mersenne cracker like [https://github.com/icemonster/symbolic_mersenne_cracker](https://github.com/icemonster/symbolic_mersenne_cracker) can be used.
